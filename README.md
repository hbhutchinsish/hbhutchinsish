This is my profile README for the first assignment.

--------

## About Me Basics!

- I'm currently majoring in cybersecurity here at UALR, this is my second semester. I got my associate's in tech and engineering over at Pulaski Tech last spring!

- My current hobbies mostly consist of reading, drawing, and attempting to play the guitar, but lately I've been invested in fishkeeping! No fish though

- I also enjoy playing video games like Stardew Valley, Minecraft, and, unfortunately, Fortnite. 🙁

- I currently live with 3 dogs and 1.5 cats! So biologically, I'm at least 7% pet hair.

- People can usually reach me over Slack and Instagram for the most part, my handle is halleishostile if anyone's interested.

- I'm currently interested in building a website that keeps track of Arkansas politicians running in local elections, and ideally I'd like it to be ready a bit before midterms this November! 😊


## About Me Advanced!

- I become obsessed with a different marine animal once every 3-6 months and I make it my entire personality.

- My computer's registered name is Spiderman

- I'm (attempting) to learn digital art and it is going badly 🥲

- I have a random broken clock that says "Happy 40th Birthday" that I got from a flea market and it's one of my most beloved items.

- I have an unhealthy relationship with blue glass birds. They speak to me. 🧍

- My current marine animal obsession are siphonophores! They're like if coral had a baby with an active predator :)))

- That's about it! Thank you for reading!
